EDITED FOR HW6: USING 2 LATE DAYS

####	Notes for Grading	####

1. Assignment completion is done up to the end of part 1, with only portions of part 2 working, such as an incomplete implementation of the UOFF verb for notifying users to of a client disconnect, mainly due to timing constraints. (This note was for the HW 5 submission.)

2. As noted above for the submission of Homework 6, 2 late days are being used in the submission of this assignment.
